## XGBoost installation ##
You may have problem with XGBoost, when program is closing without any exception when calling .fit() method or maybe in the different place in your case.
This [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39811079) has helped me to solve this porblem and after installation one of the files which are compatible to my system from [this site](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopengl) in the XGBoost section, program has began to work correctly.
